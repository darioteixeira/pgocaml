Current bugs and other problems

1. LEFT OUTER JOIN and nullability of named columns [FIXED]
---------------------------------------------------

Consider tables like:

  create table users (
    id serial not null primary key,
    u.name text not null,
    ...
  );
  create table adverts (
    author int references users (id),  -- could be null
    ...
  );

and a query like:

  select a.author, u.name
    from adverts a LEFT OUTER JOIN users u on a.author = u.id

The LEFT OUTER JOIN ensures that rows are returned even if the
adverts.author field is null.  For example, this query can return
u.name as NULL.

Unfortunately our nullability heuristic doesn't work well here.  The
u.name column is marked as NOT NULL and so we don't expect it to come
out of the database as a NULL.

The current workaround is to use PGSQL(dbh) "nullable-results" "query"
instead of PGSQL(dbh) "query".  This disables the nullability
heuristic for all columns, and so all return columns will have type
"'a option".

2. CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE [FIXED]
-------------------------

Normally at compile time, statements are only prepared in the
database.  You wouldn't ordinarily want to run statements at compile
time, since that would be dangerous.  However there is one case where
it is desirable to run the statement, and that is if the statement
creates a temporary table.  By actually creating the temporary table,
we allow further statements which use the table to be checked, and
since temporary tables are temporary, no harm is done by creating
them, even at compile time.

For this case, use PGSQL(dbh) "execute" "query" instead of PGSQL(dbh)
"query".

For example:

  PGSQL(dbh,"execute") "create temporary table employees (
     id serial not null primary key,
     name text not null,
     salary int4 not null,
     email text
  )";
  let insert name salary email =
    PGSQL(dbh) "insert into employees (name, salary, email)
                values ($name, $salary, $?email)"
  in
  insert "Ann" 10_000_l None;
  insert "Bob" 45_000_l None;
  insert "Jim" 20_000_l None;
  insert "Mary" 30_000_l (Some "mary@example.com");

Note that the CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE statement needs to come before
any statements which use the table.  There doesn't seem to be a good
way around this.

3. Specifying lists as parameters [FIXED]
---------------------------------

Suppose I want to select a subset of employees from my database.  We'd
like to be able to write:

  let employee_ids = [ 3; 4; 5 ] in
  PGSQL(dbh) "select name from employees where id in $@employee_ids"

which, at runtime, would expand to:

  select name from employees where id in (3, 4, 5)

The implementation of this is complex.  At compile time we prototype
the following statement:

  select name from employees where id in ($1)

and get the type of $1 as the type of each element in the list.  At
runtime we then have to be careful to cache each list arity separately
- quite complex if there are several lists in the statement.

This doesn't work at all if the list could be empty, because "... in
()" is a syntax error in SQL.  This is a problem with the SQL
standard.  You need to treat that as a special case.

4. Generating SQL from fragments
--------------------------------

It is fairly common to construct SQL statements from string fragments,
as in this pseudocode example:

  let order_clause =
    match key, reverse with
    | `Author, false -> "author asc"
    | `Author, true -> "author desc"
    | `Title, false -> "title asc"
    | `Title, true -> "title desc"
  let sql =
     "select title, author from books " ^ order_clause

Such statement-building is not currently permitted by PG'OCaml, unless
you ditch the camlp4 extension and use the low-level, unsafe
interface. It would be nice to have some sort of "fragment
constructor" operator to allow the above to be expressed in a
type-safe way. However because it is not possible to compile the
fragments, it doesn't look like such a constructor could be
written. If anyone has any ideas about this, please contact the
author.
