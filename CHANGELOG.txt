  or Batteries.  Auxilliary functions which used to be provided by Batteries

  This requires all array types to change from 'a array to 'a option array,
  which breaks backward compatibility.

  to/from OCaml strings.  This change is not backward's compatible,
  requiring a bump in the major version number (though there seems

  unique connection handle identifier.
